# Employee Database (Employee Tracker)

## About

This is a WIP employee tracking app using node express, inquirer, and mysql. It is intended to allow the user to view an employee database with three sql tables available: an employee list, department list, and role list. 

Due to problems testing locally, this app is not currently functional.
